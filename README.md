## Why iPlayarr?

iPlayer offers a wide range of high-quality content, but integrating it with Sonarr and Radarr has always been tricky. iPlayarr solves this problem by:

- Acting as a Newznab-compatible indexer, making iPlayer content searchable within Sonarr/Radarr
- Presenting as a SABnzbd-compatible download client, allowing automatic downloads and post-processing
- Handling the full download lifecycle, from fetching content with get_iplayer to organizing completed files

Unlike torrents and Usenet, iPlayarr operates in a less legally ambiguous space by only downloading content that is freely available for streaming.

## Why Create iPlayarr?

This project started as an experiment: Is it possible to integrate iPlayer with Sonarr/Radarr in a clean, automated way?

Most existing solutions rely on torrents or Usenet, but I wanted something that could get media from a reliable source. iPlayarr functions like a personal DVR for iPlayer, making it easier to automate downloads without needing traditional PVR software.

## Getting Started

### Download/Installation

The simplest way to use iPlayarr is via Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name iplayarr \
  -v ./cache:/data \
  -v ./config:/config \
  -v ./logs:/logs \
  -v /path/to/incomplete:/incomplete \
  -v /path/to/complete:/complete \
  --env-file=env-file \
  -p 4404:4404 \
  ghcr.io/planet22/iplayarr-turbo:latest
```

Alternatively, use the bundled Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t iplayarr .
docker run -d --name iplayarr \
  -v ./cache:/data \
  -v ./config:/config \
  -v ./logs:/logs \
  -v /path/to/incomplete:/incomplete \
  -v /path/to/complete:/complete \
  --env-file=env-file \
  -p 4404:4404 \
  iplayarr
```

Or use Docker Compose:

```yml
services:
    iplayarr:
        image: 'ghcr.io/planet22/iplayarr-turbo:latest'
        container_name: 'iplayarr'
        environment:
            - 'API_KEY=1234'
            - 'DOWNLOAD_DIR=/mnt/media/iplayarr/incomplete'
            - 'COMPLETE_DIR=/mnt/media/iplayarr/complete'
            - 'PUID=1000'
            - 'PGID=1000'
        ports:
            - '4404:4404'
        volumes:
            - '/mnt/media:/mnt/media'
            - './cache:/data'
            - './config:/config'
            - './logs:/logs'
```

You can pre-set the following environment variables, or you can set them in the Settings menu once the container is up.

| Property     | Description                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| API_KEY      | Api key to secure your iplayarr instance |
| DOWNLOAD_DIR | Download directory for in progress pulls |
| COMPLETE_DIR | Directory to move completed files to     |

There's a few more optional settings too:

| Property         | Description                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ACTIVE_LIMIT     | How many downloads are allowed simultaneously, defaults to 3                              |
| REFRESH_SCHEDULE | Cron expression for when to proactively refresh schedule, defaults to hourly, on the hour |
| HIDE_DONATE      | If you don't like the Kofi donate links you can hide them                                 |
| PUID             | Host User ID for file permissions                                                         |
| PGID             | Host Group ID for file permissions                                                        |
| LIBRARY_FOLDER_STRUCTURE | Organize completed downloads under COMPLETE_DIR into Jellyfin-style Show/Season folders (or a Movie folder), instead of one flat folder. Defaults to false |
| WRITE_NFO_STRM   | Write a Jellyfin-compatible .nfo metadata file alongside each completed item. A .strm file is only ever produced when MEDIA_MODE is `strm`; this just adds matching .nfo metadata for it. Defaults to false |

### Usage

**Authentication**

The default details are:

| Username | Password |
| -------- | -------- |
| admin    | password |

**Sonarr and Radarr link**

> **Info:** The best way to add iPlayarr to Sonarr or Radarr is to use the "Apps" section of the web UI in iPlayarr

iPlayarr presents itself as both an indexer and a download client on port 4404. You can configure it automatically in the Settings menu or manually as follows:

**Add iPlayarr manually as a Download Client**

1. Go to Settings > Download Clients in Sonarr/Radarr.
2. Add a new SABnzbd client with the following details:

| Property | Value              |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| Name     | iPlayarr           |
| Host     | Your_Docker_Host   |
| Port     | 4404               |
| API Key  | API_KEY from above |
| Category | iplayer            |

3. Test and save.

**Add iPlayarr manually as an Indexer**

1. Go to Settings > Indexers in Sonarr/Radarr.
2. Add a new Newznab indexer with these settings:

| Property        | Value                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Name            | iPlayarr                     |
| URL             | http://Your_Docker_Host:4404 |
| API Key         | API_KEY from above           |
| Download Client | iPlayarr (created above)     |

### Web Interface

To access the web frontend, visit `http://Your_Docker_Host:4404`.
From here, you can manage settings, view logs, and monitor downloads.

## Development Setup

To run iPlayarr locally for development:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (see `.node-version` for current version)
- Docker (for local dev instance of Redis)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies for both backend and frontend:

```bash
npm run install:both
```

2. Start Redis using Docker (or see Redis section below to use another instance):

```bash
npm run serve:redis
```

3. Start the development server (runs backend and frontend concurrently):

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:8080` (Vue dev server)
- Backend API: `http://localhost:4404`

### Additional Useful Scripts

| Script               | Description                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `npm run build:both` | Build backend and frontend for production |
| `npm test`           | Run tests with coverage                   |
| `npm run lint`       | Run ESLint                                |
| `npm run prettier`   | Check code formatting                     |

## Redis

iPlayarr uses Redis for storage. This is built into the container and **doesn't require any additional setup**, but if you would like to use a standalone redis instance, set the following settings:

- REDIS_HOST
- REDIS_PORT
- REDIS_PASSWORD (optional)
- REDIS_SSL (optionally 'true')

If these are all set, it will not start the bundled version of Redis.
